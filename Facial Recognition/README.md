# Facial Recognition System with Transfer Learning

Using the Inception ResNet V1 model from FaceNet as a base, the system is fine-tuned with a custom dataset for improved accuracy in identifying individuals from both images and live video feeds. The implementation is done using the PyTorch framework, making it accessible and modifiable for further research or practical applications.
