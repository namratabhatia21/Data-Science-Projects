# Research Assistant Project: Utilizing Advanced AI Models

This project explores the use of machine learning to predict stock market movements using R. The objective is to develop a model to predict future stock prices based on historical data. The project utilizes historical stock price data, potentially including features like opening price, closing price, volume, and technical indicators.
Methodology:

## Data Preprocessing:
Clean and prepare the data for analysis (handling missing values, outliers, etc.).
Feature engineering might be employed to create new informative features.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed the data to understand relationships between features and potential drivers of stock price movements.
Visualizations like scatter plots and time series plots will be used to gain insights.

## Machine Learning Modeling:
Trained machine learning models to predict future stock prices. Evaluated the performance of the trained models using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared. Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the models.
